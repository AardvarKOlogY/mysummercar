# Used elements

1. The words "Kesselin Urakointi Ky - Peräjärvi - Puh. 08 561 18" as displayed on
   [Toivo Kesseli](https://my-summer-car.fandom.com/wiki/Toivo)'s van, arranged to fit the
   respective licence plate holder. The used font is Aldine 721 Bold, which is the
   font used on the van or at least comes close enough to it.
1. A simple SVG rendering of the handyman displayed on Toivo's van, used with the basic
   vectorization settings in Inkscape (no tweking done here).

# Sizing

Different countries require different sizings. This list contains both the initial template as well as a few
other sizings for demonstration.

1. europe.svg: This template was initially used at teile-24.eu who, as a German provider, use the standard for several
   countries (not all of Europe, not all of the EU) requiring 520x110mm for the licence plate as such. Austria
   require 120mm as the plate's height, so this wouldn't fit. Countries are:
   * Czech Republic
   * Germany
   * Luxembourg
   * Netherlands
   * Norway
   * Poland
   * Portugal
   * Sweden (mostly, possible exception: 300x110mm)
   * Spain
   * UK
1. Austria, Croatia, and Hungary: 520x120mm, only minor adjustments to Europe necessary
1. United States: 300x150mm. Providers offer narrower spaces for customization, but two "lines" adjacent to the top
   and bottom edges, so the text should be distributed accordingly.
